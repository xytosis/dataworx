# Building the Twitter Classifier Assembly

Steps for building the assembly:

* Run SBT using the `assembly` target.  Example: `$ ./sbt/sbt clean assembly`

Upon successfully building the assembly, you should be able to run the various Spark jobs as documented in the [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.io/read/book/databricks/databricks-spark-reference-applications).
